After changing directory to Employee-Tracker, the user will first have to install the required npm dependancies by running ``npm i``<br>
The user will have to create the database and seed it with preliminary data by running ``SOURCE db/schema.sql;`` and ``SOURCE db/seeds.sql;`` in mySQL.<br>
The user can then initialise the app by typing ``node ./server.js``<br>
Follow the on screen prompts to create, read, update and delete from all tables.<br>
